                                    We formed in 2024 around a core member stemming from the Flare development team.
                                    All of us are based in Slovenia, keeping a close eye on crypto developments.
                                    Stakecore is a start-up in its infancy, and we are looking to expand our services in the near future.
                                    If want to join our team or have any questions, feel free to contact us.
